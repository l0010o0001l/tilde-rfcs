Status: Approved
Abstract

This RFC (number 0, known as Standard 1 in Markdown and Standard 1.1 in Plaintext) defines the format used by a Tilde-RFC when in plaintext.

Plaintext Tilde-RFC files MAY be stored with any extension commonly used by text files.

Format

A plaintext Tilde-RFC file (hereinafter "text RFC") MUST contain 3 lines, with 3 optional lines after them. These lines are metadata.

The first line MUST be the title, in the format of "RFC (number): (name)".

The next line MUST be the author's name, and MAY include their email.

The next line MUST be the status, prepended with "Status: " (see: above)

The next lines are optional, and MAY or MAY NOT be included.

The first of these optional lines is a list of the RFCs updated by this text RFC. (i.e; "Updates: 13, 35")

The next is a list of the RFCs that update this text RFC. (i.e; "Updated by: 40")

The last of these optional lines, if included, MUST be equal to "Errata Exist". This indicates that the document contains errors.

The lines after the required lines and included optional lines are the content. (see: the source of this document)
