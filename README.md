# tilde-rfcs
A RFC-esque setup for planning large collaborative projects.

## Submitting

TODO: write how to contribute in more detail

Use the template (RFC 0) and submit a PR. We'll fix your RFC number and accept your PR. Make sure to make your PR editable by contributors (checkbox at bottom) so we can edit your file.

## Amending RFCs

```
16:18 <@minerobber> you amend an RFC by submitting an RFC to update it (that's what "Updates:" is for)
20:58 <@vilmibm> got it
21:34 <@minerobber> as an example: (i'm going to copy these logs and put them in a file in the repo)
21:35 <@minerobber> Say you submit RFC 2 about migrating wiki pages and forget to mention that the section on contributing needs work
21:36 <@minerobber> you can submit RFC 3 with "Updates: 2" and say that the section on contributing needs work
```
