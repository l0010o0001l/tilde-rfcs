Know of a tool we might want? Know how to fix an issue? Here's the low-down on our contributing guidelines:

- Don't be a jerk.
- In the pull request, please specify which issue you're fixing, or what exactly your PR does. We'll try to make sure it holds to our standards.
- First time contributions are welcome! We'd love to help you fix any issues that your PR may cause, rather than getting upset towards you.

This is a [tilde.town](https://tilde.town) repo, and as such, if in doubt, see the [tilde.town CoC](http://tilde.town/~wiki/conduct.html) to see if a behavior is allowed.
